# Yugioh Banlist Twitter Bot

This is a twitter bot that sends out a tweet when there is a new banlist for the Yugioh TCG. The tweet contains the date that the banlist is effective from both for informational purposes and to ensure that each tweet is unique.

The idea is that players can turn on notifications for the bot and they will know when there is a new banlist within 2 minutes of it coming out (the bot checks for a new list every 2 minutes). The official Yugioh twitter also tweets when there is a new banlist, but it's often very slow and does so after most people are aware of the new list - which led me to create this bot. 

The account for the bot is @ygobanlistbot
